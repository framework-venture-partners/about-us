# Who we are 
We are building a different kind of venture fund. *We back the Purposeful!*  

Framework’s mission is to build world class companies that positively impact the world; those founders and teams with a true purpose.
Framework does this by combining a data-driven investment decision process with a highly collaborative engagement model designed to help visionary entrepreneurs and CEOs scale world-class companies. We invest in software companies with a focus on businesses re-imagining the consumption and seamless delivery of services within applications used frequently. Our commitment goes beyond capital; it's a partnership.


Framework’s model looks to embed financial products and services and/ or apply artificial intelligence solutions to large industry-specific datasets. 

**In simpler terms, we invest in creators and disruptors.**

We are committed to partnering with founders and leaders to build world class businesses that are changing the world. Every new team member will be part of that journey and have a significant impact in the investments we make and in the fund’s development.
